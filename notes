working with hardware: 

Kernel - the interface between HW and SW for the computer. 

uname - displayi nfo about the kernel

uanme -r/uname-a to print kernel version
	divided into Kernel space and User space. 

dmesg - display messages from the ring buffer of the Kernel

less - to redirect the messages

grep - to search for specific keywords within those messages

	Example: demsg | grep -i usb 
	search for the keyword "USB" within the dmesg

Udev:

database with HW info - devices that are connected to the system

udevadm - command the udev database

udevadm info - query the database for device info.
	Example: udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/sda5

udevadm monitor - listening for Uevents

lspci - list pci 
PCI - PERIPHERAL COMPONENT INTERCONNECT
show info about all PCI-devices configured in the system

lsblk - list block devices
lists info about block devices

sda - physical drive
|_sda1 - partition 1
|_sda2 - partition 2
|_sda3 - partition 3
|_sda4 - partition 4
|_sda5 - partition 5

lscpu - list cpu info

lsmem - list memory info
lsmem --summary - get summary of memory info 

free - show the available vs. used memory. -m for megabytes -k for kilobytes -g for gigabytes

lshw - get detailed hardware info 

Linux Boot sequence:
Starts after POST. BIOS executes the boot code from the boot device, located on the 1st sector of the HDD. In linux, it's located in /boot filesystem
POST> Boot loader(currently GRUB2)>Kernel initialization> INIT process(currently systemd)
* GRUB2: GRand Unified Boot loader2
* INIT process: up until recently - System V INIT, aka SYS5. Was used on RHEL 6 and CentOS 6. Current standard - systemd.
systemd can run service startup in parallel, rather than linear, making it quicker and more efficient than sys5.

Kernels are stored on the drive in a compressed form to save space. during startup sequence, the kernel decompresses and initializes hardware, starts memory management proesses and other things. 

check what INIT process is used by the system:
ls -l /sbin/init


Runlevels:

there's more than one way to use linux - there's Graphical User Interface - GUI , and there's Command Line Interface - CLI.

the "way to use" linux is called a Runlevel, and it can be checked with the command runlevel. 
systemd refers to a runlevel as a target
